### Installing GDoosh
    - NODE.JS
        - Firstly, install node.js from the link below. Select 'Recommended for Most Users'
            - https://nodejs.org/en/
        - Go through the installer, but remember to check the tickbox at 'Tools for Native Modules'
    - VISUAL STUDIO CODE
        - Download the installer from the link below
            - https://code.visualstudio.com/
    - DISCORD BOT
        - SETTING UP THE DISCORD BOT
            - Head to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/
            - Click 'New Application' and name it whatever you want.
            - Add in an App Icon and a description, then go over to the 'Bot' page from the sidebar.
            - Click 'Add Bot', choose a username for it, and click 'Copy' beneath the Token area.
                - IT IS IMPORTANT YOU DO NOT PUT THIS TOKEN ANYWHERE BUT IN config.json
                - If someone else gets this token, they can use your bot in every way you can.
                - If it somehow becomes public, go back to this page, click regenerate, and put that back into your config.json
            - With this token, simply put it into your config.json file.
        - INVITING THE DISCORD BOT
            - Go back to the General Information page, and click 'Copy' under 'Client ID'
            - Head to this page - https://discordapi.com/permissions.html
            - Select the permissions you would like to add. I recommend simply selecting Administator.
            - In the Client ID text box, put your copied Client ID
            - Copy the generated link and invite the bot to your server!
    - INSTALLING NODEJS PACKAGES
        - Packages are important for this to work. You must install all of these.
            - discord.js
            - quick.db
            - cli-color
            - request
            - request-promise
            - canvas
        - Open up Visual Studio Code. Go to File -> Open Folder -> Select the extracted package of the downloaded GitHub file.
        - When this loads, open up your in-built terminal (Terminal -> New Terminal)
        - For each of the packages listed above, type 'npm i [name of the package]'. Wait for it to install and do the next.
        - If you find an issue, contact EDoosh.
    - ADDING THE ACCOUNT
        - To add the account, type the account name and password into the respective places in config.json.
        - If you for some reason change either the password, account name, or switch which account it uses...
            - Put the new login info into config.json, and
            - Delete login.txt.
    - CONFIG.JSON SETUP
        - Firstly, rename 'config TEMPLATE.json' to simply 'config.json'
        - Secondly, to invite the bot to the emoji serversm see below at the bottom of the config.json chapter

### Running GDoosh
    - To run GDoosh, open up your terminal (Terminal -> New Terminal) and type 'node .'
        - You must keep this open for as long as you wish your bot to be on for.
        - If there is an issue, contact EDoosh.

### Updating GDoosh   (How I wish it could auto-update.)
    - Every so often, check the github for this project.
    - If you see an update, download it. Move over the config.json and json.sqlite files to the new folder, and leave the rest in here.
    - Delete this folder, open up the new one, and run the 'Running GDoosh' from there. 
    - That *should* be all you need to do. I will leave a notice at the changelogs if there is more.

### Encountering errors
    - No programmer thinks of every possible error. 
    - If you find one in the code, DM EDoosh and he'll sort it out.
